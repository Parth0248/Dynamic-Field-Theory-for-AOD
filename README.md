# Auditory Oddball Task (AOD) - EEG-fMRI Integration Using jICA

This repository contains the analysis and findings from our research on neural dynamics during the Auditory Oddball Task (AOD) using joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA) to integrate EEG and fMRI data.

## Overview

The project investigates how the brain processes unexpected auditory stimuli by combining the temporal precision of EEG signals with the spatial resolution of fMRI data. It highlights the activation of key brain regions and their involvement in attention, auditory processing, and decision-making during the AOD task.

## Key Features

* **EEG and fMRI Data Integration:** Utilizing jICA to reveal shared neural components across modalities.
* **Dynamic Field Theory (DFT):** Theoretical framework to interpret findings.
* **Brain Region Analysis:** Focused on prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and parietal regions, emphasizing their roles in attention, memory, and sensory processing.

## Results

* Identification of ERP components like P300, linked to auditory attention and decision-making.
* Localization of significant activations in regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cingulate cortex.
* Multimodal integration insights revealing the interaction between sensory, cognitive, and emotional processes.

## Technologies Used

* **EEG Analysis:** Preprocessing and ERP extraction.
* **fMRI Analysis:** Activation maps highlighting brain regions involved.
* **jICA:** Fusion of EEG and fMRI data to identify shared components.
* **Fusion ICA Toolkit (FIT):** Data processing and analysis.
